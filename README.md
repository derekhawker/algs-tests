algs-tests
==========

A place to try out metaheuristics and other algorithms in Scala. 

Currently has Genetic Algorithms, Tabusearch and an early work in progress of Particle Swarm Optimization.


Todo
====

- comment the algorithms to explain implementation choices
- add a class scheduling example
- add a particle swarm optimization algorithm for working with integer-like coordinate systems 


Examples
========

See the examples package for working examples that explain how to use the structures. 

HelloWorldMain shows genetic algorithms and tabusearch finding an optimial "HelloWorld" string. 

FourColours17x17Main is an attempt at using these methods to solve a colouring problem. 
Shows a more fancier use of output printing.
